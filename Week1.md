# Python Basics
Python is a programming language who do not use semicolon inn the end of the statement.

## Print in Python
In Python 2 you can print without using brackets
```
print "Akshay Bengani"
```
This is allowed in Python 2 but not in Python 3 
```
print("Akshay Bengani");
```
This is important we have to use () while in the print function.

## Input in Python
You can take input in python by using the input() function
```
a = input("Enter your name here ");
```
This will take input and store it in a variable
