# Python Expressions
Expressions are made up of variables, contants, operators, functions, Reserved Words, Comments and lot more cool stuff.

## Comments in Python
To Comment in python we use \# to comment out something.

## Type conversion 
In Python when we take input we use input() function this function only takes string type so we need to typecast when we needed a Integer operations or any other type operation other then String.

```python
age = input("Enter your age ")
age = int(age) + 5
print(age)
```

In order to do so for example we need to print age with adding +5 in it so we need to typecast String to Integer byusing int() function.

## Print Arguments
In python3 if u want to print multiple things in one print function we use ',' for the case in order to pass multiple arguments for example
```python
name = "Akshay Bengani"
print("My name is ",name)
```
Note '+' operator also works and ',' operator only works in python3 properly.

## Conditional Statements
Similar like other programming language python also uses if statements but with some different programming syntax
<br>In Python we use : insteed of blocks and a tab indentation in order to recorganize the block of code for example
```python
if z>5:
    print("Hey there")
```
## Comparision Operators

* **Boolean Expressions** ask a question and produce a Yes or No result which we use to control program flow.<br>

*  **Boolean Expressions** using **Comparison Operators** evaluate to True/False or Yes/No

* Comparison operators at variables but do not change the variables.
